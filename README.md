Dear Students,

The background corpus is about 200 Million tokens, already stemmed and stopwords are removed.

The TOEFL questions to test your word embedding can be found from the following link. The password for the zip file is "wordSpace".

I have also added an additional example for Random Indexing that might clarify how to implement the algorithm for Word Co-occurrences.

Please note that you are free to experiment with weighting functions. Although the total execution time will probably be below 30 minutes, you can speed that up by dividing the corpora to multiple files and processing each in separate threads or processes.
